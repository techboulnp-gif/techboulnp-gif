## 👋 Who Am I?

I am a detail-oriented professional transitioning from **Logistics & Transportation Management** to **Cybersecurity & IT**. With a background in supply chain optimization and team leadership, I'm now channeling that discipline and analytical mindset into building a career as a **Cybersecurity Analyst**.

Currently pursuing:
- 🎓 **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**
- 🎓 **CompTIA Security+ Certification** (Studying)

My logistics experience has taught me the importance of **process optimization**, **risk management**, and **attention to detail**—all critical skills in cybersecurity. Now I'm applying these strengths to threat analysis, network security, and incident response.
